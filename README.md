# **PredMat**

**PredMat** is a machine learning-based software tool designed to predict material properties based on manufacturing processing parameters and chemical composition. This tool aims to provide researchers, engineers, and materials scientists with a reliable, data-driven approach to understanding how different variables influence material behavior, performance, and suitability for specific applications.

## **Key Features**

PredMat leverages cutting-edge algorithms and vast datasets to empower users to:

* **Predict Material Properties:** Accurately forecast properties such as **Ultimate Tensile Strength**, **Yield Strength**, **Elongation**, and **Hardness**.
* **Analyze Impacts:** Explore how variations in chemical composition and manufacturing processes affect material performance.
* **Accelerate Design:** Streamline material design and optimization by minimizing reliance on costly, time-consuming experimental trials.
* **Improve Decision-Making:** Make informed choices in material selection and process optimization.

## **How to Use**

To start using PredMat, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Software:**
   * Download the compressed file `APP.zip` from the repository.

2. **Run PredMat:**
   * Extract the `APP.zip` file.
   * Navigate to the `dist` folder and run the `PredMat.exe` file.
   * Ensure all files remain in the same directory to ensure proper functionality.

3. **Access Additional Resources:**
   * **Datasets**: Found in the `Database` folder.
   * **Source Code**: Available in the `Code` folder.
   * **Pre-Trained Models**: Stored in the `Models` folder.
